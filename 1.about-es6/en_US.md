# About ES6

Although not all browsers now support [ES6](http://es6-features.org), but using [Babel](https://babeljs.io) is a good way to solve these problems.

We assume that you already know how to write ES5, you just don't know how to get into study ES6.

So let's begin. In our projects, we commonly using these three ES6 features:

1. [let](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/let) and [const](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/const)
2. [Arrow functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions)
3. [import](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import) and [export](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/export)

You can use these three at first, others like [Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise), [Spread Operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_operator), ... You can study them in the future gradually, and replace them into your projects.
