# How to ask?

When you have probles, or bugs, which can not solved by yourself, make sure you have done the following steps:

1. Try to find an answer by searching the Web;
2. Try to find an answer by reading the manual;
3. Try to find an answer by reading a FAQ;
4. Try to find an answer by inspection or experimentation;
5. Try to find an answer by reading the source code

If you still can't find the answer you want, you can try ask some one for help, make sure:

1. (If it's a bug) you can repeat it;
2. Use meaningful, object and specific description;
3. Talk less;
4. Describe the problem's symptoms, not your guesses

You should know, when you ask for the answer like a pupil on the Internet (BBS, mail list, IRC, ...). You would probably get nothing even taunt.

Maybe in real life, your collegues can't refuse you.

But remember, answer your question is not anybody's duety, make sure you are not going to waste thier time.

At last, if you still do not get the answer you want, you can try asking on the Internet.

Before that, **make sure you have read [this](http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html)**.
