# About SASS

When we using CSS style boxes, we often fell somehow uncomfortable. For example, we cannot use a variation to save the value we used at a lot of places, we can not use loop like while and for, sometimes we may write a monster-like long name (certainly we must avoid this), and so on. So, we have [SASS (Syntatically Awesome Style Sheets)](http://sass-lang.com).

Sass consists of two syntaxes. The original syntax, called "the indented syntax", uses a syntax similar to [Haml](http://haml.info). It uses indentation to separate code blocks and newline characters to separate rules. The newer syntax, "SCSS", uses block formatting like that of CSS. It uses braces to denote code blocks and semicolons to separate lines within a block. (That means you can write css in a .scss file)

We use the scss syntax in our projects, about scss studying and coding styles, we recommendly reading [Airbnb CSS / Sass Styleguide](https://github.com/airbnb/css#sass).
